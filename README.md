# Olongapo Route Finder

Interactive route-finder and driver-simulation demo for Olongapo City, Philippines.

The project has:

- a static frontend in [index.html](/E:/SaktoGov3/index.html:1), [app.js](/E:/SaktoGov3/app.js:1), and [styles.css](/E:/SaktoGov3/styles.css:1)
- a lightweight Python server in [app.py](/E:/SaktoGov3/app.py:1)
- live data pulled from OpenStreetMap, Open-Meteo, and optionally TomTom Traffic

This README is written so a teammate can copy the folder to another laptop or another PC and run it with minimal setup.

## Files

- [app.py](/E:/SaktoGov3/app.py:1): serves the frontend and exposes `/api/*` endpoints for bootstrap, weather, routing, and intelligent driver matching
- [app.js](/E:/SaktoGov3/app.js:1): Leaflet map UI, driver simulation, browser-side fallback data loading, and optional TomTom traffic lookups
- [passenger-driver.py](/E:/SaktoGov3/passenger-driver.py:1): Python intelligent passenger-driver matching, ranking, scoring, and explanation logic
- [index.html](/E:/SaktoGov3/index.html:1): page structure
- [styles.css](/E:/SaktoGov3/styles.css:1): styling

## What Teammates Need

For the easiest setup on another device:

1. Install Python `3.10+`.
2. Use a modern browser such as Chrome, Edge, or Firefox.
3. Make sure the device has internet access.

No `npm install`, `pip install`, virtual environment, or database setup is required for the current version. The Python backend uses only the standard library.

## Quick Start On Another PC

1. Copy or clone this project folder to the teammate's machine.
2. Open a terminal in the project folder.
3. Run:

```powershell
python app.py --port 8000
```

4. Open `http://127.0.0.1:8000` in the browser.

That is the recommended mode because the frontend will automatically use the Python backend when running on port `8000` or `8001`.

## Full Setup On Another PC

Use this if you want to set the project up from scratch on a different computer.

1. Install Python 3.10 or newer.
2. Copy the project folder to the other PC, or clone the repository there.
3. Open PowerShell or Terminal in the project folder.
4. Start the app with:

```powershell
python app.py --port 8000
```

5. Open the browser and go to:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:8000
```

If Python is not found, install it from python.org and make sure `python` is available in `PATH`.

## Share It To Other Devices On The Same Network

If one teammate wants to host it and others should open it from their own phones or laptops on the same Wi-Fi/LAN:

1. Start the server on the host machine with:

```powershell
python app.py --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

2. Find the host machine's local IP address:

```powershell
ipconfig
```

Look for the IPv4 address of the active network adapter, for example `192.168.1.25`.

3. On teammate devices connected to the same network, open:

```text
http://192.168.1.25:8000
```

Replace the sample IP with the real host IP.

If teammates cannot connect:

- allow Python through the Windows firewall on the host machine
- confirm everyone is on the same network
- keep using port `8000` unless you also update the URL teammates open

## Recommended Sharing Workflow

If you are setting this up for another PC plus mobile devices:

1. Run the project on the main PC with `python app.py --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000`.
2. Find the PC's local IP address with `ipconfig`.
3. Open `http://<that-ip>:8000` on the other PC or phone.
4. Use the `User` button for the phone-style interface and `Admin` for the desktop web interface.
5. If the page does not load from another device, check the Windows firewall and confirm both devices are on the same Wi-Fi network.

## Static-Only Mode

If someone wants to run only the frontend without `app.py`, that also works.

Example:

```powershell
python -m http.server 8080
```

Then open `http://127.0.0.1:8080`.

Important behavior in static-only mode:

- the app loads boundary, road, landmark, and weather data directly from the browser
- there is no local `/api/*` backend
- the frontend automatically stays in browser mode on ports other than `8000` and `8001`
- you can also force browser mode with `?backend=browser`

Examples:

- `http://127.0.0.1:8080/?backend=browser`
- `http://192.168.1.25:8080/?backend=browser`

## Available Backend Routes

When running `app.py`, these routes are available:

- `GET /api/health`
- `GET /api/bootstrap`
- `GET /api/weather`
- `POST /api/nearest-road-point`
- `POST /api/route`
- `POST /api/intelligent-match`
- `POST /api/best-driver`

## External Services The App Depends On

This project is not fully offline. It depends on these live services:

- OpenStreetMap tiles for the basemap
- Nominatim for the Olongapo boundary
- Overpass API for roads and landmarks
- Open-Meteo for weather
- TomTom Traffic for optional live traffic lookups

If any of those services are slow, blocked, or rate-limited, parts of the app may load slowly or fail temporarily.

## TomTom Traffic Note

TomTom traffic is now intended to be configured on the Python backend through an environment variable:

- `TOMTOM_API_KEY=your_key_here`

Example on PowerShell before starting the app:

```powershell
$env:TOMTOM_API_KEY="your_key_here"
python app.py --port 8000
```

That means:

- intelligent matching can use TomTom live traffic from the backend
- the key is no longer exposed in shipped frontend JavaScript
- if the key is missing or TomTom is unavailable, matching still works through heuristic traffic fallback

## How The App Works

1. It finds the Olongapo City boundary.
2. It fetches OSM roads inside that boundary.
3. It builds a routable graph with distance-based edges and one-way support where tagged.
4. It loads landmark-style hotspots and uses them as anchors for simulated drivers.
5. It lets the user choose pickup and drop-off points on the map.
6. It snaps those points to the nearest routable road segment.
7. In Python-backed mode, it ranks drivers through `passenger-driver.py` using the intelligent matching formula and returns the ranked suggestions to the frontend.

## Troubleshooting

- If `python` is not recognized, install Python and make sure it is added to `PATH`.
- If the page opens but stays on loading, check the browser console and confirm the device has internet access.
- If another device cannot open the app over LAN, check firewall permissions and confirm the host used `--host 0.0.0.0`.
- If map tiles appear but routing data fails, an external API request may have timed out or been rate-limited.

## Current Limitations

- Driver activity is simulated, not connected to a real ride-hailing service.
- The project uses live third-party APIs, so startup time depends on network conditions.
- Traffic data is optional and currently configured in frontend code rather than a protected backend secret.
